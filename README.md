# CMS FFS pricing

The code this set up to download and process the five different FFS rate schedules from CMS. There are five different schedules considered:
  1. Physician fee schedule (PFS)
  2. Drug Average Sale Price (ASP) schedule
  3. Clinical Laboratory (CLAB) schedule
  4. Durable Medical Equipment (DME) schedule
  5. Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) schedule

## Outstanding work
  1. Add DME PEN processing
  2. Homogenize more functions across schedules
  3. Process ASC files pre-2006
